# Machie-Learning-Practical-III
## Overview
This practical is centered on exploring and applying dimensionality reduction techniques,
with a specific focus on t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), within the context of machine learning (ML).
Including clustering algorithms like K-means and GMM alongside t-SNE for dimensionality reduction broadens the scope to 
encompass not just the simplification and visualization of high-dimensional data but also the identification of inherent 
groupings or patterns within the data

## Objectives
1. Understanding Dimensionality Reduction fundamentals
2. Deep dive into t-SNE and application to datasets
3. Exploring clustering algorithms (K-means and GMM's) and their integration with dimensionality reduction
4. Comparative analysis

## Conclusion
This practical aims to provide a thorough understanding of dimensionality reduction, with a spotlight on t-SNE, 
equipping oneself with the knowledge to effectively reduce dimensionality for various ML tasks. 
Through this hands-on experience, one learns not only the theoretical underpinnings of these techniques but also 
their practical applications.By incorporating K-means and GMM into the practical task, the focus extends beyond merely 
reducing the dimensionality of data for visualization to actively seeking and characterizing the natural groupings within the data. 
This enriched approach not only enhances understanding of the datasets being analyzed but also 
showcases the synergistic application of dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques in 
uncovering patterns and insights from complex data landscapes.
